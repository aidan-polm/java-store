# Java Store

## About
> This was created for a WGU project. Within, I used Bootstrap to style the webpages, then I used Java and Spring to populate the data and perform the backend functions. Users are able to create new parts/products, buy products, associate parts to products, and update all items. Various tests and validation checks are implemented as well.
